# MFF-DenseNet: Densely Connected Convolutional Network with Multi-scale Feature Fusion for Magnetotelluric Noise Suppression
![image](https://github.com/jiayukk/Figure/blob/main/Figure22.png)

This repository contains the code and implementation for MFF-DenseNet, a densely connected convolutional network with multi-scale feature fusion. It is designed for magnetotelluric (MT) noise suppression. The toolset includes functionalities for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, helping researchers efficiently separate signal and noise from MT noisy data.
Key words: ` Magnetotelluric` `Denoising` `Deep Learning` `Nonlinear Mapping` `Feature Reuse`
