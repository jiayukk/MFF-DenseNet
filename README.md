# MFF-DenseNet: Densely Connected Convolutional Network with Multi-scale Feature Fusion for Magnetotelluric Noise Suppression

## Project Overview
This project is designed for manuscript "MFF-DenseNet: Densely Connected Convolutional Network with Multi-scale Feature Fusion for Magnetotelluric Noise Suppression" submission to JGR-Solid Earth, providing a set of tools for the processing and analysis of magnetotelluric data. The toolset includes functionalities for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, helping researchers efficiently denoising magnetotelluric noisy data.

## Installation
1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) somewhere you can easily reach it.
2. Add the folder to your path in MATLAB
Deep Learning Toolbox

## Demo
1. Run Core_program_denoise1.m
2. Run Core_program_denoise2.m
3. Run Core_program_denoise3.m
4. Run field_data_denoise1.m to denoise field data
