# MFF-DenseNet: Densely Connected Convolutional Network with Multi-scale Feature Fusion for Magnetotelluric Noise Suppression
![image](https://github.com/jiayukk/Figure/blob/main/Figure22.png)

This project is designed for manuscript "MFF-DenseNet: Densely Connected Convolutional Network with Multi-scale Feature Fusion for Magnetotelluric Noise Suppression" submission to JGR-Solid Earth, providing a set of tools for the processing and analysis of magnetotelluric data. The toolset includes functionalities for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, helping researchers efficiently separate signal and noise from MT noisy data.

Key words: ` Magnetotelluric` `Denoising` `Deep Learning` `Nonlinear Mapping` `Feature Reuse` 

## Installation
1. Clone the git repository (Or use "DownLoasd zip" and download the ".mat" file manually.) somewhere you can easily reach it.
2. Add the folder to your path in MATLAB
Deep Learning Toolbox

## Demo

### For sythentic data 
1. Run Sythentic_data_denoise1.m
2. Run Sythentic_data_denoise2.m
3. Run Sythentic_data_denoise3.m

### For field data
1. Field_data_denoise1.m
2. Field_data_denoise2.m
   
%Field data(A)-(E) were collcted from the ore cluster area.

### Dependencies
Matlab 2021a and above

Deep Learning Toolbox

## Attention！！！
Due to github's download limitations, please download the raw ".mat" file manually.

Make sure you download the ".mat" files without using "DownLoasd zip", as GitHub's compressed downloads can corrupt large files.
